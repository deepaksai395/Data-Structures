1) Reverse a linked list.
2) Write a C routine insertlist(start1,pos1,start2,pos2,n) to insert n elements of a single linked list(having starting node 
    address as start2) beginning from pos2 into another linked list(having starting node address as start1) beginning from position pos1.
3). concatenate(start1, start2) to concatenate two doubly linked list having starting addresses as start1 and start2.
